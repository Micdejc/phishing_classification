my suggestions :
1 ) mountains ( jackson hole , aspen , banff ) are a nice respite from the houston summer . san diego ( or the baja peninsula ) are also nice - can combine golf , fishing and all kinds of outdoor activities . more exotic locales could include dominican republic , cabo san lucas ( 5 championship courses in vicinity ) , virgin islands , bermuda . i ' m not a big fan of las vegas ( although there is some good golf in the area ) .
2 ) focus should be on ( i ) improving communication across business units ( i ' m surprised by the number of people on this e - mail that i don ' t know ( well ) ) - perhaps presentations by each business unit reviewing 2000 and lh 2001 , ( ii ) identifying opportunities to profit from volatility in commodity and financial markets , ( iii ) create a "" road map "" strategic plan for the balance of 2001 and full year 2002 .
3 ) i love mountain climbing ( lived in switzerland for four years ) and am happy to organize beginner course and / or expedition with trained mountaineers . great team building therapy . otherwise , i ' m always up for golf , deep sea fishing , go kart racing , kayaking , skeet shooting , paint ball .
4 ) occasional off - sites are a great way to build / maintain morale and make sure everyone ' s on the same page regarding strategy / direction .
call if you want to discuss in more detail . i ' m serious about organizing mountain climbing .

hello everyone .
in december we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility . louise and i would like to get everyone together offsite , probably in late june ( once louise is back from holiday ( just kidding ) ) . i think it ' s time to go have a little fun with the group driving enron ' s success .
i would like suggestions as to :
1 ) where to go .
2 ) what should be the focus of the business meetings .
3 ) should we have business meetings or should we do something else ( ie . climb a mountain ) ? i ' m not a strong bid on climbing a mountain .
4 ) and any other ideas you have .
in addition i would like to start having staff meetings about once a month . the first one will be friday may 11 th at 2 : 30 p . m . please add this to your schedule . i have invited everyone who has p / l responsibility . portland , calgary and toronto will have to be on video or phone conference .

this is a great way to start .

i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we
discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we
had found that were "" show stoppers "" as far as releasing the product for beta
testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle
basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for
power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the "" fixes "" and migrated the code last night . today
during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems
with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i
talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we
plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to
introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to
postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were
comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need
consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the "" new "" streamlined version of the screens and feel that
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .

kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term
natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that
the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america
should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,
in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .
pipeline grid .
as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale
nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and
one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed
that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and
testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the
software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the
one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription
price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other
details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still
need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to
proceed with the test .
with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be
responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is
pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in
ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key
role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately
be made by the new project team .
i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it
has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the
"" affiliate "" issues ) .
let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .

re : chapter 11 reorganization
financial reporting requirements
many people have questions regarding how enron will be operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings . this memo addresses the financial reporting requirements enron will have to its various constituents .
during the reorganization , the company will continue its gaap reporting , with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities , as well as historical management / operational reporting , consistent with past practices .
in addition , the company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents . specifically , enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis . the court and our new debtor - in - possession ( "" dip "" ) lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows . the budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections . the weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows . thus this process will be an ongoing one , with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible .
the initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the dip lenders will be willing to make available to the company . in addition , the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and dip lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at enron . however , all enron business units ( not just ones in bankruptcy ) will need to conform to these new requirements , because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire company .
the weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by mike deville ( x 57852 ) and greg adams ( x 33887 ) . in addition , enron has retained batchelder & partners , inc . , a financial advisory firm , to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts .
we will be having a group meeting with the cao ' s and / or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on wednesday , december 5 at 2 : 00 pm in the boardroom on the 50 th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have . we will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements .
attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required . please review this template in advance of the wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format . obviously the requirements may change , which will require us to reformat and / or obtain additional information on short notification .
thank you in advance for your cooperation . we look forward to your attendance on wednesday .",ENRON,0

joe ,
thanks for your note .
the purpose of the fmrc is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research , real world issues and regulation .
members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center . they send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences . our center is unique in its mix of academics , practitioners and
regulators . for members , such as enron , it provides a window on the academic
world , and would give enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities .
more information on the center can be found at
http : / / mba . vanderbilt . edu / fmrc /
center members include , nyse , nasdaq , cme , some high tech trading firms ,
merrill lynch . . . .
joining the center usually requires a top management decision , but i would
approach it through the research and the trading areas . one way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year ' s conference on april 13 - 14 . the program is on the web
site . ( membership is $ 10 , 000 per year )
appreciate your interest and help .
let me know if we should provide more detail to someone .
regards ,

subject : capital book
to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .
the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .
the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .
capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .
on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .
by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .
questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :

e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that , given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
research group , with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather
group .
given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm , it makes sense
for research to charge his expenses
to global markets . we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to

64,"Subject: cost sharing of subscription to poten ' s fuel oil report
all :
ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many p & l ' s as need the
report , minimizing everyone ' s cost by sharing a single subscription .
please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so , the rc
code & co # for me to allocate your cost share . please indicate your choice
of the three cost choices .
attached note below clarifies poten ' s proposal on the $ 10 , 000 / yr subscription .
essentially we have three choices :
1 . for $ 2700 / yr , the standard edition ( 11 issues , excluding the monthly
"" special feature "" article )
2 . for $ 3800 / yr the premium edition , ( standard edition plus the monthly
"" special feature "" article , as in three attached examples )
3 . for $ 10 , 000 / yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for
36 months .
poten explains that 85 % of their subscribers take the premium service . no
one has ever asked for the $ 10 , 000 / yr long - term price forecast . i have an
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to
others in the corporation .
the example copies attached include the following special feature articles :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
one either takes all or none of them for the incremental $ 1100 / yr . some may
be useless , others perhaps quite valuable . your call .

be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price
projections over the forward 36 - month period . the forecast prices would be
accompanied by brief textual commentary . the forecasts would be issued over
the course of the one - year fuel oil in world markets subscription period .

i look forward to hearing from you .

subject : poten ' s fuel oil report
niamh & doug & margaret :
i want to chat about this and will call you , but the essence is :
can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to poten ' s monthly fuel oil
report ?
attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month
price forecasts . the cost is $ 3800 / yr .
as an added service for a total of $ 10 , 000 / yr , poten will include a quarterly
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief
justification for their view . this would include the standard monthly price
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24
months for far east , med and nwe . ( i expect a more descriptive email from
poten , but i think this is the essence of their "" custom "" offer . )
the example copies attached include the following special features :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects
related to fuel oil .
i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself
regarding the utility of such a report . the best way to show your
recommendation is with money . if it is not worth any money to anyone else in
ene , then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well . doug ,
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure
to fo prices ?

savita and i discussed this today and we both agree that this is best and that explicit change should occur now . savita is still committed to staying until the end of 2001 , getting in some new talent in her group , training brad , working with webb , taking care of the traders , etc . i will talk with her in december or january about what might be next for her .
jay webb is also supportive of this . when he and i agreed that savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large , complex development job , he said brad should take the role . jay works well with brad and thinks brad , with time , will work well in andy zipper ' s old role . jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for enrononline and will be working closely with brad and savita .

anne ,
thanks for contacting me about this .
as a matter of fact , i wanted to talk to you about it
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time .
i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager ,
effective march 1 . the compensation would be her current base plus
10 k . this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager .
such promotions take place in march and i think
gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
( i . e . my and maureen ' s procrastination ) .
on unrelated and more serious matter . gary hickerson is the primary client
for maureen ' s services . he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is
unwilling to underwrite maureen ' s position ( he is in general unhappy with
her contribution ) . this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron .
given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge .
gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget .
i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes .

vince ,
just wanted to touch base with you . i have tried to contact maureen so that gwen ' s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested , but have not heard any response from her . would you like for me to wait until i hear from maureen or should i go ahead and proceed in changing her title ? i just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc .
also , i am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing , and your expectations during prc .
thanks ,
